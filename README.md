# Starwavatar

Inspired by [GitHub Identicons](https://github.com/blog/1586-identicons), the Force is strong with these randomly generated graphics.

## A New Hope, For Gravatar Fallbacks

Starwavatar is very much a diminutive furry creature of a Rails app, containing only a single route `/avatars`. You can laser-blast any value to the end of that route and end in either `.svg` to return a SVG or `.png` to return a PNG.

## The Original Trilogy of Iconsets

The icons are generated by _forcing_ [Jory Raphael’s](http://sensibleworld.com/news/more-free-star-wars-icons/) iconset (used with permission) through random noise generated by an Imperial probe droid, splitting the colours into a Tatooine sunset rainbow and displaying the result. 

## The Gravatar Awakens

Starwavatar works great as a fallback for displaying an Identicon for folks who don’t have a Gravatar.

A generic Gravatar URL looks like this:

`https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/<md5sum>`

But you can pass a default value:

`?default=https%3A%2F%2Fpath.to.your.starwavatar.host%2Favatars%2F<md5sum>.png`

## May the Starwavatar be with you: Deployment

If you set your warp drive co-ordinates to [Heroku](https://heroku.com), just upload this repo and you’re ready to go. If you want to play with the colors generated, everything happens in `app/models/starwavatar_avatar.rb` using the [Paleta gem](https://github.com/jordanstephens/paleta).

In theory, if you’re all set with Heroku, this should work:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:teamtito/starwavatars.git
cd starwavatars
heroku create
git push heroku```

The app itself shouldn’t require much by way of resources to run, but if you’re going to use it in production, you’re going to want to put it in front of a CDN to make sure that requests for the same asset get cached and delivered from an edge endpoint. We use [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com) and it works great.
